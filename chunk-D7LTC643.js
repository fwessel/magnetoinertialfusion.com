We represent Zeonics Systech, Bangalore India, who is a leading manufacturer of innovative product solutions in these areas. Since 1981 Zeonics has provided products characterized by the highest quality and performance available on the world market and LES has partnered with them since 2017. "),t(),e(6,"p"),n(7," LES also offers for sale a two-color, laser-interferometer diagnostic available in two configurations - as a 1-dimensional, line-of-sight instrument and a 2-dimensional, transverse-imaging instrument. This interferometer design is robustly stable with a broad range in sensitivity and can be used to quantitatively measure density as a dispersive phase shift in plasma, gas, and liquids. Dispersion interferometry is a tremendous simplification over conventional methods in terms of its simplicity, performance, and cost. Please refer to the several published papers on these instruments. "),t(),e(8,"p"),n(9," It will be my pleasure to provide you with the highest level of support for your research needs.
